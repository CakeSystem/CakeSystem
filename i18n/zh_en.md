# Version Log
```
2.0.6
Optimized power compensation, the power compensation option is now hidden, and power is allocated to all miners by default 
 
Optimized E9pro, now all mining pools can run full E9pro, and the calculation of e9pro in rust is accurate and consistent with the mining pool 
 
Added a pumping mode 
 
Added a mode for connecting mine pools 
 
Optimized mining machine with high computing power


2.0.5

[Important Update] Fixed a bug where RUST was suspended in windows 
 
Fixed high inefficiency of kas Glacier and other chip machines 
 
Compatible with the etc gtv66 chip, improve the etc computing power calculation 
 
Fixed some bugs in power statistics

2.0.4 
The default mode of computing power compensation is optimized to further reduce inefficiency 
 
Optimized the performance of kaspa under different mining pool protocols, lolminer and gminer now work in all mining pools 
 
Optimized the calculation logic of the etc related algorithm, and now the calculation and pumping are more accurate 
 
The underlying optimization improves the hardware utilization 
 
Optimized share display bug 
 
Optimize the home active distribution list

2.0.3
Fixed a serious BUG caused by disconnection reconnection mechanism

2.0.2
Fixed a software crash caused by concurrency  
Statistical optimization of computing powe

2.0.0 
Multiple client details optimization 
 
Now the pumping accuracy is MAX 
 
Added power compensation configuration, now the loss of power compensation can be configured on the port 
 
The mechanism of re-connection of broken lines is added to ensure that the mining machine with frequent disconnection can also pump normally 
 
Fixed kas high invalidation bug 
 
The underlying algorithm engine was updated and reconstructed, and began to rapidly support small coins 
 
Added SC currency 
 
Added CFX currency 
 
Fixed an issue where LTC was highly ineffective in viabtc 
 
Fixed an issue with inaccurate LTC power display 
 
Fixed LTC computing power loss problem 
 
Remove the limit on the number of pumping wallets 
 
Lifting cross-pond pumping restrictions 
 
Optimized port logs, added program runtime logs, and enabled device logs

The low-level optimization avoids several bugs that are easy to cause program crashes
